              Norris would go on to star in a streak of bankable
              independently-made action and martial arts films, with A Force of
              One (1979), The Octagon (1980), and An Eye for an Eye (1981). This
              made Norris an international celebrity. He went on to make studio
              films like Silent Rage (1982) with Columbia, Forced Vengeance
              (1982) with MGM, and Lone Wolf McQuade (1983) with Orion. This led
              Cannon films to sign Norris into a multiple film deal, starting
              with Missing in Action (1984), which proved to be very successful
              and launched a trilogy. Norris started to work almost exclusively
              on high-profile action films with Cannon, becoming their leading
              star during the 1980s. Films with Cannon included Invasion U.S.A
              (1985), The Delta Force (1986), Firewalker (1986), etc. Apart from
              the Cannon films, Norris made Code of Silence (1985), which was
              received as one of his best films. In the 1990s, he played the
              title role in the long running television series Walker, Texas
              Ranger from 1993 until 2001. Until 2006, Norris continued taking
              lead roles in action movies, including Delta Force 2 (1990), The
              Hitman (1991), Sidekicks (1992), Forest Warrior (1996), The
              President's Man and its sequel (2002). Norris made his last film
              appearance to date in Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables 2
              (2012). Throughout his film and TV career Norris diversified from
              his regular endeavors. He is a noted writer, having penned books
              on martial arts, exercise, philosophy, politics, Christianity,
              western novels, and biography.

              He was twice a New York Times bestselling author, first with his
              book on his personal philosophy of positive force and the
              psychology of self-improvement based on personal anecdotes called
              The Secret of Inner Strength: My Story (1988). His second New York
              Times Best Seller, Black Belt Patriotism: How to Reawaken America
              (2008), was about his critique on current issues in the USA.
              Norris also appeared in several commercials endorsing several
              products most notably being one of the main spokespersons for the
              Total Gym infomercials. In 2005, Norris found a new fame on the
              Internet when Chuck Norris facts became an Internet meme
              documenting humorous, fictional and often absurd feats of strength
              and endurance. Although Norris himself did not produce the
              "facts", he was hired to endorse many products that incorporated
              Chuck Norris facts in advertising, the phenomenon resulted in six
              books (two of them New York Times best sellers), two video games,
              and several appearances on talk shows, such as Late Night with
              Conan O'Brien where he read the facts or participated in sketches.

              Carlos Ray "Chuck" Norris (born March 10, 1940) is an American
              martial artist, actor, film producer, and screenwriter. After
              serving in the United States Air Force, Norris won many martial
              arts championships and later founded his own discipline Chun Kuk
              Do. Norris is a black belt in Tang Soo Do, Brazilian jiu jitsu and
              judo.[2] Shortly after, in Hollywood, Norris trained celebrities
              in martial arts. Norris went on to appear in a minor role in the
              spy film The Wrecking Crew (1969). Friend and fellow actor Bruce
              Lee invited him to play one of the main villains in Way of the
              Dragon (1972). While Norris continued acting, friend and student
              Steve McQueen suggested to him that he take it seriously. Norris
              took the starring role in the action film Breaker! Breaker!
              (1977), which turned a profit. His second lead Good Guys Wear
              Black (1978) became a hit, and Norris became a popular action film
              star. Norris would go on to star in a streak of bankable
              independently-made action and martial arts films, with A Force of

              In 1979, Norris starred in A Force of One, where he played Matt
              Logan, a world karate champion who assists the police in their
              investigation. The film was developed while touring for Good Guys
              Wear Black. Again no studio wanted to pick it up, but it
              out-grossed the previous film by making $20 million at the box
              office. In 1980, he released The Octagon, where his character must
              stop a group of terrorists trained in the ninja style. Unlike his
              previous films this time the studios were interested. American
              Cinema Releasing distributed it and it made almost $19 million at
              the box office.In 1981, he starred in Steve Carver's An Eye for an
              Eye, co-starring Christopher Lee, Richard Roundtree, Matt Clark,
              and Mako Iwamatsu. The following year, he had the lead in the
              action horror film Silent Rage (1982) it was his first film
              released by a major studio Columbia Pictures. In the film, Norris
              plays a sheriff who must stop a psychopath who goes on a rampage
              after being granted near-indestructibility in a medical
              experiment. Shortly afterward MGM gave him a three-movie deal and
              that same year, they released Forced Vengeance (1982). Norris was
              unhappy with the direction they wanted to take with him, hence the
              contract was canceled.

            <p class="text-center mt-5">
              In 1983, Norris made Lone Wolf McQuade with Orion Pictures. He
              played J.J. McQuade, a reckless Texas Ranger who'd rather work
              alone but who gets a new partner because his captain would like to
              have him supervised. The partners investigate an arms dealer
              played by David Carradine. The film was a worldwide hit and had a
              positive reception from movie critics, often being compared to
              Sergio Leone's stylish Spaghetti Westerns. The film became the
              inspiration for Norris's future hit TV show Walker, Texas Ranger.
              Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film a 3.5 star rating, calling
              the character of J.J. McQuade worthy of a film series and
              predicting the character would be a future classic. The same year,
              he also published his second book about general exercising called
              Toughen Up! the Chuck Norris Fitness System. Also in 1983, Xonox
              produced the video game Chuck Norris Superkicks for the Commodore
              64, Commodore VIC-20, Atari 2600, and Colecovision. The game
              combines two types of gameplay: moving through a map, and fighting
              against enemies. The player takes control of Chuck Norris who has
              to liberate a hostage. It was later sold as Kung Fu Superkicks
              when the license for the use of the name Chuck Norris expired.
